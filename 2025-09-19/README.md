Friday, 19 September 2025 — 5:00 PM

Overview
--------

Lecture 1 of "Generative AI Training: Building Generative AI Applications" delivered by Prof. Jason Mar. The session focused on practical setup and foundational concepts for getting started with Jaseci and Jac.

Lecture highlights
------------------

- Industry gap: a brief discussion on skill shortages and opportunities where generative AI can make immediate impact across sectors.
- Development setup: recommended editor is Visual Studio Code and the `Jac` (Jaseci) extension for writing and running Jac programs.
- First program: create and run `myfile.jac` (included in this repository) to verify your environment. Example:

```jac
with entry {
	print("Hello, Jaseci!")
}
```

- ANN primer: conceptual input → node → output flow to build intuition about neural architectures.
- Jac language & install: short introduction to Jac and pointers for installing Jaseci tools locally or using the VS Code extension.

Quick start
-----------

1. Install Visual Studio Code: https://code.visualstudio.com/
2. Install the `Jac` / Jaseci extension from the VS Code Marketplace.
3. Open this repository in VS Code and run `myfile.jac` to confirm the setup.

Additional resources
--------------------

- Jaseci documentation: https://jaseci.org/ (installation and usage guides)
- Jac language reference: see the Jaseci docs and the VS Code extension help

Repository contents
-------------------

- `myfile.jac` — first Jac program used in class: prints "Hello, Jaseci!"
