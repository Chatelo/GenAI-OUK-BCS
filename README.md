This short intro summarizes the key items covered in Lecture 1.

## Key points covered

- Gap in the tech industry: where AI skills are needed and opportunities for impact.
- Tools setup: install Visual Studio Code and add the `Jac` (Jaseci) extension.
- First program: create `myfile.jac` and run a simple program (example provided in this repo):

```jac
with entry {
	print("Hello, Jaseci!")
}
```

- Intro to Artificial Neural Networks (ANN): basic input → node → output view and intuition.
- Jac language: brief introduction and installation pointers for getting started with Jaseci and Jac.

## Quick start

1. Install Visual Studio Code: https://code.visualstudio.com/
2. Open VS Code and install the `Jac` / Jaseci extension from the marketplace.
3. Create `myfile.jac` in the project root with the example above and run it using the Jaseci tooling or extension.

## Notes

- This repository holds the `myfile.jac` example used in class.
- The lecture focused on practical setup and foundational concepts; further materials and code samples may be added to this repo as the course progresses.
