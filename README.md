## README Update Guidelines

To maintain consistency when adding new projects or updating this README:

- **Course Description**: Keep the top-level title and introductory paragraph intact. Only update links or minor wording if the course details change.
- **Project Chronology Section**:
  - Use `## Project Chronology` as the header.
  - List projects from **newest to oldest** (reverse chronological order).
  - Mark the most recent project with `ðŸš€ Latest:` in the header for visual emphasis.
  - Each project should have:
    - A `###` header with the project folder link (e.g., `[2025-XX-XX-project-name/](folder-name/)`).
    - A bullet point for `- **Date:**` in "Month DD, YYYY" format.
    - A bullet point for `- **Description:**` with a brief (1-2 sentence) summary of the project's focus, tools, and key concepts.
  - Use Markdown links for any external references (e.g., course providers).
- **Styling Conventions**:
  - Use `#` for main title, `##` for sections, `###` for subsections.
  - Bold key terms with `**` (e.g., **Date:**).
  - Add emojis sparingly for catchiness (e.g., ðŸš€ for "Latest").
  - Keep descriptions concise and professional.
- **When Adding a New Project**:
  - Insert it at the top under "Project Chronology" and mark it as `ðŸš€ Latest:`.
  - Update the previous "Latest" to remove the ðŸš€ and emoji.
  - Ensure the date matches the project folder's naming convention.
